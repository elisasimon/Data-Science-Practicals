# Alcohol consumption in Switzerland and neigborhood between 1960 and 2014
In this report, I am interested in __alcohol consumption in Switzerland and neigborhood between 1960 and 2014__. The five countries of interest are the following:
  
* Austria
- France
+ Germany
* Italy
- Switzerland

_The dataset I used is from @holmes_convergence_2017 and can be downloaded from the website [OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption), in the section "Total alcohol consumption over the long run"._

```{r, include=TRUE}
# Because the variables names were quite strange and included symbols R doesn't like, I had to clean a little. To do this I have notably used the clean_names() function which requires to load the janitor library.

library(janitor)
df_clean <- clean_names(per_capita_alcohol_1890)
df <- df_clean %>% dplyr::rename(alcohol_consumption = alcohol_consumption_since_1890_alexander_holmes_2017)

# because the dataset contains other countries (and years) than those I am interested in, I have to do some data preparation - in order to have an easy access to the pertinent data only. Here's how I went:

d <- df %>%
  filter(entity %in% c("Austria", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Switzerland"),
         year >= "1960",
         year <= "2014")

```

## Evolution of alcohol consumption in Switzerland and neigborhood
If we look at the graph below, we can observe that the alcohol consumption has decreased in each countries, except in Austria.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(d, aes(x = year,
              y = alcohol_consumption,
              color = entity)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs (title ="Alcohol Consumption Evolution by country",
        x = "years",
        y = "alcohol consumption (in liter) per person") +
  theme_minimal()

```

### Ranking of countries depending on their alcohol consumption in 1960
1. France
2. Italy
3. Germany & Switzerland
4. Austria

### Ranking of countries depending on their alcohol consumption in 2014
1. Austria
2. Germany
3. France
4. Switzerland
5. Italy

## Alcohol consumption in each country (average from 1960 to 2014)
The graph below show that, in average, French people tend to drink more alcohol (on average) than the ones living in Austria, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. Even if - as we saw above - the tendance is decreasing.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
aus <- d%>%
  filter (entity == "Austria")
fra <- d%>%
  filter (entity == "France")
ger <- d%>%
  filter(entity== "Germany")
ita <- d%>%
  filter(entity == "Italy")
swi <- d%>%
  filter (entity == "Switzerland")

aus_m <- mean(aus$alcohol_consumption)
fra_m <- mean(fra$alcohol_consumption)
ger_m <- mean(ger$alcohol_consumption)
ita_m <- mean(ita$alcohol_consumption)
swi_m <- mean(swi$alcohol_consumption)

ac_mean <- c(aus_m, fra_m, ger_m, ita_m, swi_m)
countries <- c("Austria", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Switzerland")

df_mean <- data.frame(ac_mean, countries)

ggplot(df_mean, aes(countries, ac_mean)) +
  geom_col() +
    labs (title ="Alcohol Consumption overall by country",
        x = "Countries",
        y = "alcohol consumption (in liter) per person") +
  theme_minimal()
```


# Conclusion

![Austria, the country where people tend to ~~be alcoholic~~ drink more and more over years](https://www.coe.int/documents/16695/61254353/ECRI-vienna-news-june-2020.jpg/64b94a41-d8dd-5f48-16b5-caaa4d260f49?t=1591084794000)

## Alcohol consumption evolution
Globally, we can observe a tendency of decrease in alcohol consumption in Switzerland and neighborhood, except in Austria where people drink 1.7 supplementary liter of alcohol in 2014 than in 1960. The greatest decrease is found in France, where people drink 8.5 liters of alcohol less than in 1960.

## Alcohol consumption nowadays (well, in 2014)
Despite France is overall the country where people have drank the more alcohol since 1960, the huge increase of alcohol consumption in Austria makes it the contry where people have drank the more alcohol in 2014, with in average 10.4 liters of alcohol per person.
